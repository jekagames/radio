			{ time: 8.966, text: "Maybe you have known in the core of your being since you were three years old. Or maybe not." },
			{ time: 13.509, text: "Maybe you discovered the language that describes you best when you were in your twenties, and it was like coming home, or finally being able to stretch out an ache." },
			{ time: 21.263, text: "Maybe you have known for years, and maybe you came out to yourself yesterday." },
			{ time: 25.437, text: "Maybe you hated to look at yourself in the mirror, once you learned enough to know what society told you you were, and what you weren't." },
			{ time: 32.023, text: "Maybe you like your body just fine, and it's other people misgendering you that cuts to your core." },
			{ time: 37.132, text: "Maybe your narrative isn't neatly wrapped up with any bow, and doesn't fit any mold." },
			{ time: 41.691, text: "Maybe sometimes, you have to pretend that your gender identity is simpler than it is to get away from the questions, or for the comfort of those who don't understand you." },
			{ time: 49.908, text: "Maybe you have tried to convince yourself that your physical reality is irrelevant, that your gender is meaningless, that you are just a consciousness." },
			{ time: 57.642, text: "This probably isn't even the first time that you tune your long-range finders to this area, to this broadcast." },
			{ time: 63.041, text: "Maybe you've been waiting, and trying to decide if you are going to make the leap, try out our little adventure, and see where you end up." },
			{ time: 70.099, text: "No matter how you come to us, you are enough, you are enough, you are enough. You are trans enough, you are valid enough, you are simply...enough." },
			{ time: 78.865, text: "We know that there's no such thing as a Utopia, but hey, whatever we make together can't be worse than here, right?"},
			{ time: 85.407, text: "...Find us...<br>Eight. Nine. Five. Repeating transmission. Eight. Nine. Five.<br>...Find us..."}

			{ time: 0, text: "This is a Public Service Announcement brought to you by the Trans Radio Artists Network in Space." },
			{ time: 5.137, text: "If you are a human being between the ages of zero months and however old the oldest living human being is (maybe like 107, probably?), this message concerns you." },
			{ time: 14.785, text: "We live under the kyriarchy, the systems of privilege and oppression that we all participate in." },
			{ time: 19.261, text: "If you feel that you are losing out when society is made more equitable, it is only because you had so much to begin with and others had so little." },
			{ time: 26.593, text: "Respect lived experiences. It is possible that someone else has experiences that you yourself have not had." },
			{ time: 32.160, text: "Social constructs still have power and influence over our behaviour even if they are constructs." },
			{ time: 36.949, text: "Ideological purity is a privilege. Navigating the kyriarchy is complicated." },
			{ time: 41.288, text: "Recognize genders beyond the binary. Many cultures have historically recognized non-binary genders." },
			{ time: 47.322, text: "Trans Women are Women. I repeat, Trans Women are Women." },
			{ time: 51.728, text: "Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminists are not feminists. Intersectional feminism is the only feminism." },
			{ time: 57.765, text: "For more information, listen to marginalized people when they tell you about their lived experiences." }
